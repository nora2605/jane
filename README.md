# Janelang

This repository contains the Standards for the Jane Language and Jane Object Hierarchy Notation Language as well as the primary Jane implementation.

SHJI/C stands for Schleswig-Holstein Jane Interpreter/Compiler, which is a pendant to the name of the Haskell Compiler which is also named after a geographical location.

## Credit

HUGE Thanks to the [Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/) Book by Thorsten Ball. Most of the code (as of July 2023) is a slightly altered workthrough of that Book.

I encourage everyone who also wants to build their own language to read this book, it gives enough insight that your own changes to the behavior of the Language seem intuitive.
